26887,General purpose quantum computing," Method and apparatus are provided for a general purpose photonic computer. A data signal is input through an encoder to encode such signal with an instruction. The encoded signal is transmitted by means of a laser beam to an input buffer where it interferes with a reference beam so as to form an interference pattern therein as a hologram, IPH. A read beam is directed through the IPH and through a decoder which reads the instruction as having, e.g. an OP Code, data source and destination. The decoded instruction is forwarded on the read beam to ALU spin media which respond to the instruction by flipping spins between two energy levels, in one or more sequences of data patterns which are read or measured by one or more sensors. Such sensors can be RF, microwave or optical sensors, which sensors output Radix=2 or digital data signals for, e.g. storage, display or further processing as desired. Thus the present invention teaches a novel exploitation of photon-induced, quantum-mechanical spin transitions in spin media. The input signal can be from a keyboard, camera, bar code or other input source. ",Methods of Building Qubits
27640,Quantum acceleration of conventional non-quantum computers," A process and apparatus for quantum acceleration of a conventional computer by coupling a few quantum devices to the conventional computer. Initially, a first, second, and third maximally entangled qubit are prepared in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. A fourth qubit is prepared in a perfect superposition of states which is unentangled from the three qubits. The second qubit is then measured and its measured value is input to the conventional computer. The conventional computer operates on this measured input value and performs an inverse oracle function. The second qubit is modified according to the output from the conventional computer. This modified qubit is used as one of two control inputs for controlling a quantum gate. The other control input is the fourth qubit. The quantum gate phase inverts the third qubit according to the two control inputs. A measurement of the complement of the first qubit is taken in order to produce the necessary quantum interference of the third qubit. The third qubit can now be measured to find the correct final solution. An N-bit quantum accelerated computer can be constructed by implementing N numbers of 4-qubit sets.

23223,Quantum computing method using Josephson junctions between s-wave and d-wave superconductors,"A solid-state quantum computing structure includes a set of islands that Josephson junctions separate from a first superconducting bank. A d-wave superconductor is on one side of the Josephson junctions (either the islands' side or the bank's side), and an s-wave superconductor forms the other side of the Josephson junctions. The d-wave superconductor causes the ground state for the supercurrent at each junction to be doubly degenerate, with two supercurrent ground states having distinct magnetic moments. These quantum states of the supercurrents at the junctions create qubits for quantum computing. The quantum states can be uniformly initialized from the bank, and the crystal orientations of the islands relative to the bank influence the initial quantum state and tunneling probabilities between the ground states. A second bank, which a Josephson junction separates from the first bank, can be coupled to the islands through single electron transistors for selectably initializing one or more of the supercurrents in a different quantum state.

15348,Magic state distillation with low space overhead and asymptotic input count,"Disclosed herein are example embodiments of protocols to distill magic states for T-gates. Particular examples have low space overhead and use an asymptotically optimal number of input magic states to achieve a given target error. The space overhead, defined as the ratio between the physical qubits to the number of output magic states, is asymptotically constant, while both the number of input magic states used per output state and the T-gate depth of the circuit scale linearly in the logarithm of the target error. Unlike other distillation protocols, examples of the disclosed protocol achieve this performance without concatenation and the input magic states are injected at various steps in the circuit rather than all at the start of the circuit. Embodiments of the protocol can be modified to distill magic states for other gates at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, with the same asymptotic performance. Embodiments of the protocol rely on the construction of weakly self-dual Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes (â€œCSS codesâ€? with many logical qubits and large distance, allowing one to implement control-Swaps on multiple qubits. This code is referred to herein as the â€œinner codeâ€? The control-Swaps are then used to measure properties of the magic state and detect errors, using another code that is referred to as the â€œouter codeâ€? Alternatively, one can use weakly-self dual CSS codes which implement controlled Hadamards for the inner code, reducing circuit depth.

22269,Under-resolved quantum-array state mapping,"A quantum register can be read out using under-resolved emissions mapping (e.g., imaging). Regions of the quantum register are illuminated concurrently, one array site per region at a time, typically until all sites of each region have been illuminated. A photodetector system then detects for each region whether or not an EMR emission (e.g., due to fluorescence) has occurred in response to illumination of a respective site in that region. The result of the photo detections is a series of emissions maps, e.g., images. The number of emissions maps in the series corresponds to a number of sites per region, while the number of pixels in each image corresponds to a number of regions. A readout result can be based on a time-multiplexed combination of these emissions maps. The emissions maps are under-resolved since the resolution corresponds to the region size rather than the sizes of individual array sites.",Methods of Building Qubits
